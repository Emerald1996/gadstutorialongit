    <p style=" text-align: center;">

        Step 1 boil the noodles <br><br>
To make this easy recipe, begin with par-boiling the noodles. Once done, drain the excess water and keep it aside. In the meantime, heat a pan over a medium flame. Once the oil is sufficiently hot, add the ginger-garlic paste and fry for some time. If you like to make it more delicious, add some finely chopped green chillies. You can also use chillies soaked in vinegar.

    <p>Step 2 <br><br> Toss the veggies and cook the eggs
Then add the onions, beans and green chillies in the same pan and saute for a minute or two. Add the carrots, cabbage, salt, pepper powder, soy sauce and Ajinomoto. Stir-fry the ingredients for some time. Once done, add the boiled noodles and break the eggs into the pan. Mix well and cook for a few minutes. If you like smoky flavours, stir the veggies mix on a high flame.</p>

<p>Step 3 Garnish and indulge in the goodness <br><br>
Cover the pan with a lid and allow it to cook for around 2-3 minutes. Once done, serve or dish in a bowl and garnish it with moringa leaves. Serve hot and pair it with a spicy gravy of your choice. Make sure you try this recipe, rate it and let us know how it turned out to be.
